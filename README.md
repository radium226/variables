## Overview

The `variables` tool helps you to store (sensitive or not) variables next to your code  in a standardized format. 

Those variables can the be exported to multiple formats ([ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/), [.env](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/security/env.html), etc.) or directly injected as environment variables.
